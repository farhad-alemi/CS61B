<p style="font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold; margin: 0;">Rules</p>

<p>
  Each move consists of moving a piece of your color horizontally,
  vertically, or diagonally onto an empty square or onto a square occupied by
  an opposing piece, which is then removed from the board.  A piece may
  jump over friendly pieces (without disturbing them), but may not cross
  enemy pieces, except one that it captures.
  A piece must
  move a number of squares that is exactly equal to the total number of
  pieces (black and white) on the line along which it chooses to move
  (the <em>line of action</em>). This line contains both the squares
  behind and in front of the piece that moves, as well as the square the
  piece is on.  A piece may not move off
  the board, onto another piece of its color, or over an opposing piece.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;">Controlling Play</p>

<p>
  To move a piece, simply drag and drop a piece to a desired location. The
  pieces may also be played by AI (see "Setting" tab). To retract moves, select
  "Retract" under "Game".
