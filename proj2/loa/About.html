    <em>Lines of Action</em> is a board game invented by Claude Soucie.
    It is played on a checkerboard with
    ordinary checkers pieces.  The two players take turns, each moving a
    piece, and possibly capturing an opposing piece.
    The goal of the game is to get all of one's pieces into one group of pieces that
    are connected. Two pieces are connected if they are adjacent horizontally,
    vertically, or diagonally.
    Initially, the pieces are arranged as shown in Figure 1.
    Play alternates between Black and White, with Black moving first.

    <blockquote><strong>Figure 1.</strong> (a) Initial position, showing standard designations for rows
        and columns. (b) Possible moves for the black piece at f3. In (b) the
        piece at f3 cannot move horizontally to the right because it would be forced to
        move 4 steps, which would push it off the board. The same piece cannot move
        vertically up because there are 4 pieces in the vertical line of action and moving
        4 steps up would require it to move over enemy pieces.

    Figure 1b illustrates the four possible moves
    for a black piece in the position shown.
    (The examples here are taken from the
    <a href="http://www.boardspace.net/loa/english/index.html">BoardSpace webpage</a>.)
    The move f3-d5 is a capture; all others are ordinary moves.
    The diagonal moves are all two squares, since there are two pieces
    along each of the diagonals shown.  The horizontal move is four squares
    because of the four pieces in row 3.
</p>

<p>
    The game ends when one side's pieces are contiguous: that is, there is
    a path connecting any two pieces of that side's color by a sequence of steps to
    adjacent squares (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), each of which
    contains a piece of same color.  Hence, when a side is reduced to a single
    piece, all of its pieces are contiguous.  If a move causes both sides' pieces
    to be contiguous, the winner is the side that made that move.
    One can have infinite games, where players just
    repeat positions indefinitely.  We will prevent this with a move-limit
    rule: if the current move limit is <em>L</em> moves (the default is 60),
    then after the two sides both make <em>L</em> moves combined, the game ends in a tie.
    Figure 2a shows a final position.
    Figure 2b shows a board just before a move that will give both sides
    contiguous pieces.  Since the move is White's,  White wins this game.

    <blockquote><strong>Figure 2.</strong> End positions. Position (a) is a win for Black.  In position (b),
        White can move as shown, capturing an isolated black piece and
        giving <em>both</em> players contiguous pieces. Since
        it is White's move, however, the result is counted as a winning position for
        White.
